flags:
  optimized: 0.80        # >=80% keeps tensor workloads fully saturated
  warning: 0.60          # 60-79% indicates headroom remains
  degraded: 0.45         # 45-59% likely blocked by data or IO
  critical: 0.30         # <=30% shows GPU is mostly idle

notes:
  - "Optimized performance is expected at 80% utilization or better."
  - "Thresholds follow sandbox guidance for CUDA-based ArcFace inference."
